# What I learned

I learned a lot about asynchronous code, development in flutter, modular programming and organization in general. Of course, I had the pleasure of picking up the Dart language as well. 

Overall had a lot of fun over the 3-day course that this video series took me to complete.

## What's next? 

Next, I will continue by creating a firebase + flutter app. 

Eventually I want to create a blindfold chess app.
